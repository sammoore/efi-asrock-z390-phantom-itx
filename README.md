# EFI for ASRock Z390 Phantom ITX

This is my ongoing EFI folder. If I find a certain version stable enough, I will mark the version accordingly with a GitHub tag.

## Disclaimer

I am not liable for any damage to your hardware by using this folder. In many cases, you should not use this folder verbatim; for example, if you have made any changes to your BIOS that differ from mine, or we are running different version BIOS, there's no guarentee this will work. Also, for example, if I have used a DSDT.aml file, it will almost certainly cause issues. This is not an exhaustive list of reasons this won't work, either.

If you don't understand this disclaimer in its entirety, you should probably start with a guide. That's not what this repository is. As _nguyenmac_ once said on a relavant forum:

## License

For the license itself, see `LICENSE.md`.

### Rationale

**Disclaimer**: I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.

Since I will likely pull code in from RehabMan's repositories in a few instances, I have chosen GPLv2 for this repository. Any code licensed under something more permissive that I end up incorporating here should be compatible to the best of my knowledge.

Many files come from places with a more permissive license, and I may not have made any modifications to the work. In such cases, you can use the work in the original license. For example, to the best of my knowledge, Clover is licensed under a BSD license.

If I have made a mistake, either accidentally purposefully, by relicensing into GPLv2 in an incompatible manner, please open an issue or contact me. I am not a license wizard.
